
SHREDBOARD - aka Gui-type Hero for Ubuntu


This is a python tool that lets you treat a standard Nintendo Wii Guitar Hero as a chordal keyboard.
It's very silly and probably useless, but surprisingly fun at the same time.


Installation:

1. Get Ubuntu up and running (other distros will probably work fine but I don't have any to hand)


2. You'll need to install python, xdotool and cwiid-python with a command like

sudo aptitude install python xdotool cwiid-python


3. Go into the /src/ directory and type "python sb.py", then pretty much immediately press the 
1 and 2 buttons on the wii controller at the same time.  It should connect.






I played with the letter config a fair amount, and settled on AEIOU as the single five buttons, then
spread the other letters out primarily by distribution, but also by similarity of letter (b & d have
the same shape, as do p & q and m & w).  Keeping Dvorak in mind, I tried to keep the th, sh, ch
combinations close and near the red button.  Suggestions for improvements always welcome, obviously.

The stick has comma, full stop, delete and Upper-Case-The-Next-Letter.  Hold down the red button and
the stick acts as arrow keys.

Whammy bar is Enter.

I've not done anything with the plus and minus yet.
