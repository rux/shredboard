
SHREDBOARD - aka Gui-type Hero for Ubuntu


This is a python tool that lets you treat a standard Nintendo Wii Guitar Hero as a chordal keyboard.
It's very silly and probably useless, but surprisingly fun at the same time.

You'll need to install xdotool and cwiid



I played with the letter config a fair amount, and settled on AEIOU as the single five buttons, then
spread the other letters out primarily by distribution, but also by similarity of letter (b & d have
the same shape, as do p & q and m & w).  Keeping Dvorak in mind, I tried to keep the th, sh, ch
combinations close and near the red button.  Suggestions for improvements always welcome, obviously.

The stick has comma, full stop, delete and Upper-Case-The-Next-Letter.  Hold down the red button and
the stick acts as arrow keys.

Whammy bar is Enter.

I've not done anything with the plus and minus yet.
